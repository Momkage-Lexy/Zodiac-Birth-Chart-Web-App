This project utilizes HTML(with Bootstrap), CSS, JavaScript(with JQuery) to create
a webpage that takes in user information and returns a natal chart listing all of their
zodiac signs. The left side of the main content is a toggle list describing placements 
and on the right and at the bottom there is an image gallery which provides information of the 
signs. There is an opportunity for the user to enter their email address to _Join Our Newsletter_,
however, I do not know how to use .php stuff yet, so for now that feature creates an alert confirming 
the information was submitted. 

Disclosure
---------
_Calculating natal charts is much more complex then I orginally thought. Signs can change within a time difference of 
15 minutes, and vary by birth location. Coupled with changing celestial body positions over time... well it wasn't something 
I could fully accomplish in two weeks. I tried a few different libraries but couldn't do what I needed without backend support.
This is a project I'd like to return to in my own time, but for now, this project returns the accurate Sun sign and random 
signs for all the others. Poor planning on my part._
